   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>With chocolate, biscuits, butter and sugar you can make one of the most loved desserts in home cooking, the chocolate salami! Also called Turkish salami or Viking salami depending on the region of Italy, it owes its name to the resemblance to a real sausage both for the shape and for the white coating made with icing sugar.</p>
   <p>Each family has its own recipe: we have chosen to make the chocolate salami without eggs and flavor it with a drop of rum, but you can try many other delicious variations such as coffee, nougat or exotic fruits. Perfect for a snack, for a birthday or for a simple end of a meal, chocolate salami has always been an irresistible temptation for young and old!</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the chocolate salami, first take the ingredients out of the refrigerator so that they are at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Chop the dark chocolate with a knife and melt it in the microwave then let it cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour the butter and sugar into a separate bowl and start working with a whip.</li>
        <li>When you have reduced the butter to cream, pour the rum slowly while continuing to mix.</li>
        <li>Finally add the warm chocolate, give a quick stir and also add the unsweetened cocoa powder, making sure to mix everything until you get a homogeneous mixture.</li>
        <li>Crumble the dry biscuits with your hands and add them to the chocolate mixture, then mix with a spatula to incorporate them evenly.</li>
        <li>Now take a sheet of baking paper and pour the mixture into the center, shaping it with your hands to give it a cylindrical shape.</li>
        <li>Lift the bottom flap and wrap the paper around the cylinder, then roll up the ends to seal it.</li>
        <li>Transfer the roll to the refrigerator and let it harden for at least 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li>After this time, remove the baking paper and sprinkle with powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>Your chocolate salami is ready to be sliced and enjoyed!</li>
